Welcome to Human-First AI
=========================

**Why:** With Human-First AI, we aim to put human insight, human control, and human values back on center-stage. 
The AI/ML era should be about combining human and machine inteligence, and not substituting one for the other.
It should be about the elevation of humanity, and not our subjugation.

**What:** More specifically, for real-world AI, with H1st AI [#]_, we aim to solve three critical challenges:
  1. Insufficient data for machine learning
  2. Messy, Unprincipled AI system development processes
  3. Concerns with Trustworthy AI

**How:** H1st AI is designed with the following principles:

.. include:: concepts/principles.rst.txt

**Where:** H1st AI is based on experience building AI solutions at Panasonic, Fujitsu, Furuno, Tesla Gigafactory, etc.
It has been applied to real-world systems in applications ranging from robotics predictive maintenance, 
cold-chain energy optimization, battery mfg, avionics, automotive cybersecurity, and more.

**Who:** H1st AI is an open-source project created by Christopher Nguyen and his team at Aitomatic, Inc.
It is maintained by Aitomatic and other contributors. The repository can be found at https://github.com/h1st-ai.

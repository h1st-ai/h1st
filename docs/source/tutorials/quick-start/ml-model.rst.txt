MLModeler and MLModel
#####################

In `h1st`, we explicitly split the machine learning activities into two categories
and assign them to `MLModeler` and `MLModel`. `MLModeler` is responsible for
data loading, data exploration, data preparation and model training/building
while `MLModel` generates predictions, persists and loads model parameters.

The easiest way to understand H1st `Model` is as a standardized format for
writing information processing nodes. Furthermore, the root H1st `Model` class
already handles most of the functionality needed to manage the full life-cycle
of the model from peristing, loading, and version control. For machine-learning
models or any model that requires the fitting of parameters or various processes
for model creation, the H1st system highly recommends the creation of an
accompanying H1st Modeler. This is because Model creation lies outside of the
operational cycle. In this way, to implement an H1st Model all you really need
is to implement the `process` function. A `Modeler` will implement activites such
as model training/building/evaluation, data loading, data preparation, and data
exploration.

The `MLModel` class adds on to the base `Model` by adding a `predict` method
which aliases the `process` method to support traditional ML design flows.
Additionally, the `MLModel` help clarify in complex systems which components
are powered by machine-learning and which are not, since many types of `Model`s
in an H1st AI system can act on data through rules, logic or analysis. 

Below is an example of an H1st MLModel and MLModeler that utilize an underlying
Scikit-learn LinearRegrssion model. Note that while MLModel's have a `predict`
function, this function simply is an alias for the `Model.process` function, so
only `process` need be implemented.

            """Run model inference on incoming data and return predictions in a
               dictionary. 
               Input data should have key 'X' with data values
            """
            predictions = self.base_model.predict(data['X'])
            return {'predictions': predictions}
            

    class MyMLModeler(h1.model.model.MLModeler):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            self.model_class = MyMLModel

        def train_base_model(self, prepared_data):
            """trains and returns the base ML model that will be wrapped by the
               H1st MyMLModel
            """
            X, y = prepared_data['x_train'], prepared_data['y_train']
            model = LogisticRegression(random_state=0)
            model.fit(X, y)
            return model

        def load_data(self):
            """Implementing this function is optional, alternatively data can
               be passed directly to the build_model function
            """
            pass

        def  evaluate_model(self, data: dict, ml_model: MLModel) -> dict:
            """Optional, if implemented then metrics will be attached to the
               trained model created by the build_model method, and can be
               persisted along with the model

            x_test = {'X': data['x_test']}
            y_test = data['y_test']
            y_pred = ml_model.predict(x_test)['predictions']
            accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
            return {'accuracy_score': accuracy}
            

By calling `MLModeler`'s `build_model` method, you get an instance of `MLModel`
and are able to run inference on new data and evaluate the model's accuracy.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Model training and prediction

    X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.33, random_state=42)
    prepared_data = {'x_train': x_train, 'y': y_train,
                     'x_test': x_test, 'y_test': y_test}
    my_modeler = MyMLModeler()
    my_model = my_modeler.build_model(prepared_data)
    accuracy = my_model.metrics['accuracy_score'] * 100
    print(f"Accuracy (test): {accuracy:.1f}%")

When you are satisfied with the model, you can persist its parameters for later usage such as model serving.

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Model persistence and loading

    # This saves the model in the the model repository, auto-generating the
    # latest version number
    version = model.persist()
    # Alternatively, a specific verion can be specified with model.persist(<version>)

    # This loads the latest version of the model from the model repository
    my_model_2 = MyMLModel().load_params()
    # Alternatively, a specific version can be loaded with:
    # my_model_2 = MyMLModel.load_params(<version>)

    # Now you can run your predictions
    y_pred = my_model_2.predict({'X': X_test})['predictions']
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    print("Accuracy (test): %0.1f%% " % (accuracy * 100))

    # Additionally, any stats and metrics set during model creation were also
    # persisted
    accuracy = my_model_2.metrics['accuracy_score'] * 100
    print(f"Stored Accuracy (test): {accuracy:.1f}%")


So each of your model classes only needs the `process` method to be implemented
and should extend the appropriate H1st model. Each of your modelers, only needs
the `model_class` attribute defined (either in the __init__ or as a class var)
and neeeds the `train_base_model` method implemented. Optionally, you can
implement `load_data` and `evaluate_model` methods for enhanced functionality,
but everything else is taken care of by the framework. 

For automation of model persistance and loading you only need to set the
environment variable `H1ST_MODEL_REPO_PATH` or define `MODEL_REPO_PATH` in your
`config.py` file (see Installation section). The framework uses this to
automate either local storage or storage in an S3 bucket.  Currently, the H1st
framework supports easy persistance and loading of any Model to a model
repository as long as the base_model is serializable.

Pretty simple, isn't it. Enjoy building your machine learning models!!!

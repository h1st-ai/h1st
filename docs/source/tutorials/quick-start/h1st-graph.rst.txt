H1st Graph
##########

An H1st Graph object encapsulates an execution flow chart that allows Models
and Actions to be smoothly tied together. This structure enables both ML and
Human-knowledge models to be incorporated into a seemless data processing and
inference pipeline.

This is an example of a very simple graph which prints hello for each even
number x in the input stream, using a conditional RuleBasedModel. The
rule-based model extends the h1st Model class implying that it processes the
incoming data to produce some prediction, transformation or analysis on that
data. The HelloPrinter class extends the h1st Action class implying that it
performs a simple action in response to some input.

In this case the model determines whether or not the input data is an even
number. The Action HelloPrinter is only passed the even-number data where the
model returned True. 

.. code-block:: python

  from h1st.model.model import Model
  from h1st.h1flow.h1step import Action

  class RuleBasedModel(Model):
      """
      Simple rule-based model that "predicts" if a given value is an even number
      """
      def process(self, input_data: dict) -> dict:
          predictions = [{'prediction': x % 2 == 0, 'value': x} for x in input_data["values"]]
          return {"predictions": predictions}

  class HelloPrinter(Action):
      """Print hello to the inputs value"""
      def call(self, command, inputs):
          # Note that H1st does the conditional/filtering orchestration already.
          # All we need to do here is just to print.
          for d in inputs["predictions"]:
              print("Hello world {}!".format(d["value"]))


The H1st graph itself is created by adding nodes incrementally.

.. code-block:: python

  from h1st.h1flow.h1flow import Graph
  from h1st.h1flow.h1step import Decision, NoOp

  g = Graph()
  g.start()

  # In the first Node, the data is passed to the RuleBasedModel's "process"
  # method and a Decision is rendered from model output.
  g.add(h1.Decision(RuleBasedModel(),
                    result_field="predictions",
                    decision_field="prediction"))

  # In the second Node, if the True or "yes" data is passed to HelloPrinter's
  # "call" function, and the False or "no" data is passed to NoOp's "call"
  # function. NoOp is default null Action and nothing happens. 
  g.add(yes=HelloPrinter(), no=NoOp())
  g.end()

  # Now that the graph is built, we run pass input data through that graph
  results = g.predict({"values": range(6)})

Note that the first Node is an h1st Decision which redirects the data flow
into the later yes and no nodes based on the RuleBasedModel’s predictions.
Inference is done in batch-mode so first the RuleBasedModel predicts for all
input values, then the "yes" or True values are passed to the HelloPrinter
action while the "no" or False values go to the NoOp null Action.

In terms of data flow, the input to the Graph predict method is passed to the
RuleBasedModel's process function which in turn produces a dict. The Decision
object forwards a dict containing the result_field "predictions" to the
HelloPrinter's call function if the Decision is True and does nothing (NoOp) if
the decision is False. In this way, the Graph simplifies the construction of
complex action and information relay flows.

  Hello world 0!
  Hello world 2!
  Hello world 4!

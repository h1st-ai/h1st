Rule-Based Model
################

A rule-based model is an example of applying human knowledge to solve a
problem. You could use boolean logic or fuzzy logic and make decisions based on
statistcs or myriad other ways that humans do to solve problems.

A rule-based model is very useful for solving the cold start problem, where
data is not available.

In the H1st framework, a human rule model can be implemented by subclassing the
h1st `Model` class or `PredictiveModel` class and implementing only the
process() function. Basically, it’s a just a model with no training (though
training is not forbidden and is sometimes is useful for human models too).

If for some reason your rule model does require training or parameter tuning,
then you can implement a `Modeler` in the same way as the `MLModeler` except
just extending the H1st `Modeler` class.

This particular simple model “predicts” if each given value in a stream is an
even number or not.

.. code-block:: python

  from h1st.model.model import Model

  class RuleBasedModel(Model):
      """
      Simple rule-based model that "predicts" if a given value is an even number
      """
      def predict(self, input_data: dict) -> dict:
          predictions = [x % 2 == 0 for x in input_data["values"]]
          return {"predictions": predictions}

  m = RuleBasedModel()
  xs = list(range(6))
  results = m.predict({"values": xs})
  predictions = results["predictions"]
  print(f"RuleBasedModel's predictions for {xs} are {predictions}")


.. code-block::

  RuleBasedModel's predictions for [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] are [True, False, True, False, True, False]
